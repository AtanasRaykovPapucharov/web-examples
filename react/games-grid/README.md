# FrontEnd - Game Grid
Implement a ReactJS casino grid app

## Requirements
The app should have two views:
* **Grid View** – shows a list of games with title and thumbnail in a grid layout. First game in the collection should be shown as big one. Upon clicking on any of the items, the “Active Item View” is shown.

* **Active Item View** – shows thumbnail, title and description of the game. A “playbox” is shown in the center, which will only include a loading animation (game loading simulation)
